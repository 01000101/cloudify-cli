## Deploying your first application - Walkthrough
**1. Installing the CLI and a provider extension:**
  - Install Cloudify CLI (temporary url, will be on PyPI soon):  
  `pip install https://github.com/CloudifySource/cosmo-cli/archive/develop.zip`  
  (Note: if you're using Pip 1.5 or above, add the "*--process-dependency-links*" flag to the 'pip install' command)  
  (Note: after installing the cli you can run the "activate_cfy_bash_completion" script which will permanently add bash completion to you shell
  and then follow the instructions or run "eval "$(register-python-argcomplete cfy)"" if you want to activate bash completion for your active shell only)

  - Install a Cloudify provider extension (Openstack is used in this example):
  `apt-get install python-dev # or the equivalent *nix version of this command`
  `pip install https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-openstack/archive/develop.zip`

<br>
**NOTE: you can run CLI commands with the -v (verbosity) flag to view tracebacks and additional debug info.**

**2. Initializing:**
  - Cd into your favorite working directory and initialize Cloudify for some provider:  
  `cfy init openstack`

  - Edit the autogenerated provider-specific config file "*cloudify-config.yaml*" - update its mandatory (non-commented) settings as needed.  
    (For more information about the configuration files parameters used in this example, view the [Cloudify-Openstack readme](https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-openstack/blob/develop/README.md))

  - Bootstrap cloudify on Openstack:  
  `cfy bootstrap`  
  You can also use the -a flag to bootstrap using the script instead of using the packages (the packages' urls can be found under *cloudify-config.yaml*)
  This is probably temporary (in favor of development purposes), afterwhich the flag will be depracated.

  This could take a bit of time to finish... Looking for something to do in the meanwhile? http://dynamic.xkcd.com/random/comic/

<br>
**3. Deploying your application:**
  - Upload your blueprint:  
  `cfy blueprints upload my-app/blueprint.yaml -b hello_world`  
  (Don't have a blueprint? You can download a sample one [here](https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-hello-world/tree/develop/openstack)).

  - Create a deployment of the blueprint:  
  `cfy deployments create -b hello_world -d my-deployment`

  - Execute an install operation on the deployment:  
  `cfy deployments execute install -d my-deployment`

This will install your deployment - all you have left to do is sit back and watch the events flow by until the deployment is complete.

<br>
**4. Fetching execution events:**
  - List deployment executions:
  `cfy executions list -d my-deployment`

  - Fetch execution events by execution id:
  `cfy events --execution-id f6269ccf-1243-439e-b779-c0f8d06a9894`

## Providers
A provider is any platform which allows for the creation and bootstrapping of a management server (e.g. Openstack). The CLI can work with any provider once the appropriate extension has been installed. A provider extension is provider-specific code which handles environment-related operations such as bootstrap and teardown.

Note that the CLI can be used even without the installation of any providers - if you already possess a bootstrapped management server, you may simply direct the CLI to work with that server (`cfy use <management-ip>`), and you can then issue any of the CLI commands to that server (with the exception of the "**cfy teardown**" command)


###Currently Supported Providers:
* [Openstack](https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-openstack/tree/develop)
* [Vagrant](https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-vagrant/tree/develop)


### Creating a new provider extension:
Provider extensions are simply Python modules which adhere to certain conventions and implement a certain interface.  

By convention, the module name is called "*cloudify_<provider-name>.py*". While any name is viable in practice, the CLI **cfy init** command, which receives a '*provider*' parameter, is set to first search for a module named by the convention, and only search for the exact '*provider*' value given if such a module was not found.

Every provider extention is expected to implement the following interface:

  - **init**(*target_directory*, *reset_config*, *is_verbose_output=False*)  
    - **Description**: This method is used to create any required configuration files at the given target directory, as well as make any other initializations required by the specific provider.  
    - **Parameters:**:
      - *target_directory* - Target directory for configuration files, if any.
      - *reset_config* - A boolean describing whether overwriting existing configuration files is allowed.
      - *is_verbose_output* - A flag for setting verbose output
    - **Returns:**: False if a configuration file already exists and reset_config is False; True otherwise.
  
  - **bootstrap**(*config_file_path=None*, *is_verbose_output=False*)  
    - **Description**: This method is used to set up the management server as well as the environment (e.g. network) in which it resides. It is currently also responsible for bootstrapping the server as a management server.  
    - **Parameters**:
      - *config_file_path=None* - A path to an appropriate configuration file to be used in the bootstrap process. If one is required yet not passed, the Provider is expected to assume this command is called from the same path from which "init" was called, and search for the relevant file in the current directory.
      - *is_verbose_output* - A flag for setting verbose output
    - **Returns**: The IP of the bootstrapped management server.
  
  - **teardown**(*management_ip*, *is_verbose_output=False*)  
    - **Description**: This method is used to tear down the server at the address supplied, as well as any environment objects related to the server which will no longer be of use.
    - **Parameters**:
      - *management_ip* - The IP of the management server to teardown.
      - *is_verbose_output* - A flag for setting verbose output
    - **Returns**: None.  


Another convention worth mentioning is one used for the Provider's **init** method: While a Provider may create any number of provider-specific configuration files on init (or none at all) in any format it so chooses, the standard is for it to create a single configuration file in YAML format named "*cloudify-config.yaml*". Additionally, it's recommended that all default values in the file are commented out, for ease of use. 

---


## Working-Directory Settings and Configurations

When running the CLI **cfy init** command, a "*.cloudify*" file will be created in the target directory. All local settings (such as the default management server and aliases) are stored in that file, and only take effect when using the CLI from the target directory.

Additionally to creating the "*.cloudify*" file, the **cfy init** command will usually also create a provider-specific configuration file named "*cloudify-config.yaml*", which will later be used by the **cfy bootstrap** command. This, however, is merely a convention, one which various providers may choose not to follow.

Note: If the Cloudify working directory is also a git repository, it's recommended to add "*.cloudify*" to the .gitignore file.
